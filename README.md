##To Do List:

###Trivial:
- Add a "back space button" so users can delete the most recent input
- Prevent display from overflowing

###Straightforward:
- Change calculator layout to be more aesthetic.
    - make the "0" slightly bigger (two buttons wide)
    - More diverse colors

###Complex:
- Add a secondary display that shows current operator being used
- Scale the font size depending on size of display
